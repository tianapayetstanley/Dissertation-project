# 🎓 Immutable Aid — Blockchain DApp for Transparent Aid Box Distribution

This project is part of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science dissertation. It explores the use of blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable distribution of physical aid boxes in disaster relief efforts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add and update aid box entries on-chain
- Track the status of each aid box (e.g., Pending, In Transit, Delivered)
- Owner-only access control
- Built with Solidity and Hardhat
- Frontend built with React (in progress)

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) for contract code
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/) for blockchain interaction
- [React.js](https://react.dev/) for the frontend

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tianapayetstanley/Dissertation-project.git
   cd Blockchain-Dapp-Dissertation/backend

2. Start the local blockchain:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat node

3. Compile and deploy the smart contract:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
